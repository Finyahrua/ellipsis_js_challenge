<!-- how to run the project -->
1.Clone the repo into your chooses directory
2.Run the command:
<!-- navigate to the project directory -->
    $ cd <directory>
    <!-- install the required dependencies -->
    $ npm install
    <!-- run the project, the project opens on port 3000 -->
    $ npm start

<!-- how I decided on the technical and architectural choices used as part of my solution -->
1. I choose to use react since I have been doing react native for quite some time and I wanted to use a similar technology that I am already familiar for this project.

2. React library is also a good choice due to the available large community and also the ability to create reusable components. This saves a good amount of time and effort in creating the same component over and over again.

3. I chose to use react-router-dom since it is a good choice for routing.

4. I didn't use a framework for styling in this project even though I have use tailwind-react-native for some time because I wanted to minimize the time to learn new stuffs and focus more on the project.

<!-- Are there any improvements you could make to your submission? -->
Yes, I could make improvements to the submission by testing for responsive design and generally improving the UI, with more time I would have found a way to set up tailwind css and definitely that would have enabled me to write less code and spend less time debuging the code.

<!-- What would you do differently if you were allocated more time? -->
I would have tried to run more tests on the project to ensure everything was working as expected.
I also would have tried to combine the MovieDetails Screen And the search screen into one component.
Hopefully that would maybe improve the performance of the project.

Generally I am really glad I was able to do this project and I am looking forward to working on other projects as well. I learnt a lot too considering I hadn't done pure react project for a while.

Thank You kindly,
John, Finyahrua Adrian
